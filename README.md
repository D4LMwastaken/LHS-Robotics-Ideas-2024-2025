# LHS-Robotics-Ideas-2024-2025
This is my ideas of what changes should be made to the Largo High School Robotics Club. I have divided every topic into folders and their own *.md
## Beliefs
* Hybrid + specialization approach to roles
* Protect "common" team members from tyrannical rule
* Accountability is key

Note: Archived as plans have been implemented
