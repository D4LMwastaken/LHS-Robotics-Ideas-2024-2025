# Possible Goals

## New Stuff
* 3d printer in robotics room (faster and more reliable 3d printing) (thinking of Hollins...)

## Parts management
* 3 parts inspections: One before season, one in the middle of the season and one after the season
* If parts, items, etc. are being taken home, a photo/form/something needs to be written down about where it is going, for how long and what thing and what quantity. Also reason...
  * Mr. Wood and your team + rest of teams must be notified
* After inspection is completed, all teams should have necessary parts
* For parts inspections, the hundreds of quantities such as some types of screws and nuts do not be super precise but need to be precise enough

### Necessary parts for each team
* Go Builda U channels
* 4 odometry wheels
* 1 control hub and one expansion hub
* 4 motors
* Wring necessary to connect parts listed above and below
* Assortment of gears, screws and nuts
* Safety googles (Maybe eyeglasses side protections?)
* 1 battery
* 1 switch
* Servos?
* Tools necessary to use screws and nuts
* Odomoetry pods?
* Driver Hub

## Design Committee
* Veteran designers + sponsors + mentors + head builder and head programmer for the team
* What needs to be included is a parts list, 3d cad model and physical representation
  * For complex intake/outake system, a 3d animation or a 2d animation or a physical prototype is a good idea

## Design Process
* Each designer in the team doing one sketch (very basic) of what they want the robot to look like and do
* Full team meeting where the whole team judges the designs for top 3 (designs can get merged also)
* The 3 designs get full 3d cad
* Parts list is created
* Top 3 get sent to design commitee

## Approach to teaching new programmers/builders/designers/outreach
* Hands on and classroom approach
* 1 demo robot for programmers (odometry wheels+servo+odometry pods)
* 1 demo robot for builders (odometry wheels)
