# Programmers

## Head Programmer
* Veteran programmer from last season (if possible)
* Lead programming team
* Make sure designers make a design that is programmable

## Structure & my ideas
* If possible (split into 2, one doing teleop, the other doing autonomous)
* Find collaboration software (CodeTogther Live) and is accessible later (GitHub)
  * Note on GitHub: Do not have multiple GitHub repositories for the same thing or the names of the repository have not been changed, will get headaches later on...
* Example of GitHub Repository: One for Teleop, one for autonomous and one where both are merged
  * Another note on GitHub: Use branches, they allow programmers to program their idea if it is a big one

## Outreach programmer (Outreach+Programmer)
* Help create website
* Help program robot used for outreach
